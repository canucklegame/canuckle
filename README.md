Canuckle is a daily Canadian word guessing game inspired by the original [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## How to Play

Guess the CANUCKLE in 6 tries.
Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the colour of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- Red: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Grey: The letter is incorrect.

The answer will be a word/place/Canadianism related to Canada in some way, and a fun fact will be displayed after you play!

A new CANUCKLE will be available each day!
