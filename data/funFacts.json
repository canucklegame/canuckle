When it was gone from Canadian waters, kelp forests declined because urchins and other animals that eat seaweed weren't controlled by the otter preying on them. With the return of the otter, kelp forests are in much better shape. This is important because healthy kelp forests provide habitat to fish and reduce coastal erosion by slowing water currents.

Millar was working for the Ontario Department of Transport when he came up with the idea in 1930. A stretch of highway between Quebec and Ontario was the first to receive the treatment. Millar’s idea soon received wide acceptance — within a few years, white painted lines were standard not only on highways in Ontario but all across North America, and accident rates dropped significantly.

The creek winds its way across a hundred miles of wind-swept prairie until it empties into the mighty South Saskatchewan River. The first known name is believed to have come from the Cree, who referred to it as \"kisiskâciwan\", meaning \"it flows swiftly.\" When early fur traders found the creek on their westward treks in the 1800s, they named it \"Rivière Au Courant.\" For quite some time, Swift Current was the freight terminus for Western Canada. Swift Current is affectionately known as \"Speedy Creek\", a synonymous play on words. As the primary service centre for most of Southwestern Saskatchewan, its name is also frequently contracted to \"Swift\" or \"Swifty\", but has no ties to Taylor Swift's fan base of Swifties :)\n\nJoin the #CanuckleCrew on ",
