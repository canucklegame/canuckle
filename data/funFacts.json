When it was gone from Canadian waters, kelp forests declined because urchins and other animals that eat seaweed weren't controlled by the otter preying on them. With the return of the otter, kelp forests are in much better shape. This is important because healthy kelp forests provide habitat to fish and reduce coastal erosion by slowing water currents.

Millar was working for the Ontario Department of Transport when he came up with the idea in 1930. A stretch of highway between Quebec and Ontario was the first to receive the treatment. Millar’s idea soon received wide acceptance — within a few years, white painted lines were standard not only on highways in Ontario but all across North America, and accident rates dropped significantly.
